# IBM-Data-Science---Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto
I will learn how to convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, I will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto. I will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. I will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.

Once the data is in a structured format, I will analysis and  explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city.
